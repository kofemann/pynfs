Server testing
==============

   USING:
   =====
   ./testserver.py SERVER:PATH <options> <tests>
   ./testserver.py SERVER:PATH <--rundeps | --force> <--maketree> -v all
   --maketree Needs to be run the first time testserver is used, creates
              directory/file structure most tests expect
   --force    Run exactly the tests listed on command-line, ignoring 
              dependencies. NOTE that the default is to try to run exactly 
	      the tests listed, but if a test's dependencies are not run the 
	      test will be skipped
   --rundeps  In addition to tests listed on command-line, run tests that
              are listed as dependencies.
   -v         Show tests as they are being run
   --noinit   Skip initial cleanup/testing of directory tree.  This is useful
              for quickly running tests that do not need it, such as most
              of the exchangeid tests.
  Tests are indicated by either a CODE (unique to a test) or a FLAG (which
     is a way of grouping similar tests).  The list of flags can be seen
     using the --showflags option.  Each code/flag can be preceeded by "no"
     to prevent running of that test.  code/flags are read from left to
     right, and effects are cumulative.  Thus:
         ./testserver SERVER:PATH --force -v all noopen OPEN1
     will run all tests, except for the open tests, but will run the test OPEN1

  All tests are located in nfs4/server41tests/st_*.py
  Generic test configuration is done in nfs4/server41tests/environment.py
      init/finish - routines run at start/end of program
      startUp/shutDown - routines run at start/end of each test
      In particular, tests use two principals, they are hardcoded currently 
          nfs4/server41tests/environment.py:Environment.__init__()

  MISC:
  =====
  Current tests are fairly minimal, as spec has been changing fairly rapidly.
  Good for correctness testing, handling of error/unlikely paths, any test
     where it is the order of RPCs that matter
  Not good for performance testing, tests where timing of RPC's matter.
  Checking state of returned RPC's can be tedious, so tests work best
     if need only check return stat or a few flags.
   It is possible to send individual commands by hand using 
       nfs4/nfs4client.py:NFS4Client(), but requires a bit of familiarity with code.


Server
======

  nfs4/nfs4server --help
  nfs4/nfs4server --reset

  Passed all the (non-locking) cthon tests with draft-10 
     (except for large file test), with both auth_sys and krb5
  
  Limitations:
      So far focused on session/pnfs ops, so:
          other ops (in particular locking) haven't been implemented yet
	  ACCESS control is a huge stub
      Unused structures are never cleaned up...so will eventually run out
          of memory
      SLOW
      Multi-user access has never been tested, and is likely buggy

  PNFS-block:
      Has some very basic facilities for handling block layouts
      Currently functions, as long as client behaves

  PNFS-files:
      Support for pnfs-files has been added (--use_files, --is_ds flags).
      See README-filelayout

  Client-testing:
      More difficult, since control over what RPCs are sent is so indirect.
      Write to /config/ files, changes server behavior
      	    PRO - nothing special needed on client side
	    CON - need enough functionality to write to file
      Communicate via side-channel.
      	    PRO - allows full control of server, even if client is 
	              completely non-functional
		  Is easier to control more complex behavior.
	    CON - Have to use python test framework on client
      Possibilities - simulate server reboot, cause error return on given ops,
      		      give client userland-access to the (unencrypted)
		      RPCs it sent.

Proxy
======

	nfs4proxy --port=<local port> --dserver=<destination IP> --dport=<destination port>
		  --errorfile=<file having error description>

	The proxy forwards the calls form the client to the server. It can be used with any server and client. Also, it can be used with pNFS if the server and the dataserver are colocated

     Error injection framework:
	   The user needs to write to a file (errorfile parameter, default error.xml)
	   The format of the xml file is:
	   <errorconf>
	   <error>
	   <name>the name of the error condition</name>
	   <operation>operation this error condition applies to</operation>
	   <operation>can be more than one</operation>
	   <errorcode>error code to be returned</errorcode>
	   <errorcode>more than one can be specified (picks one randomly)</errorcode>
	   <delay>delay this operation by that many seconds</delay>
	   <frequency>
	   probabability for the error to be applied
	   1 = 1/1 (100%)
	   2 = 1/2 (50%)
	   3 = 1/3 (33%)
	   etc.
	   </frequency>
	   <function>function name from errorfunctions.py to be applied if errorcode
	   is not specified e.g. shortread</funtion>
	   </error>
	   <error>
	   another error condition -- apply in sequential order
	   ...
	   </error>

	   example error.xml:
	   <errorconf>
	   <error>
	   <name>sequence1</name>
	   <operation>READ</operation>
	   <function>short_read</function>
	   <delay>0</delay>
	   <frequency>1</frequency>
	   </error>
	   <error>
	   <name>create session</name>
	   <operation>CREATE_SESSION</operation>
	   <operation>SEQUENCE</operation>
	   <errorcode>NFS4ERR_DELAY</errorcode>
	   <errorcode>NFS4ERR_BADSESSION</errorcode>
	   <delay>0</delay>
	   <frequency>2</frequency>
	   </error>
	   </errorconf>
